## Stats 
I'm a Backend Developer specialized in the .NET platform with 5 years of experience.
I participated in the development of several applications, always using the best development practices such as Clean Code, SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.

Passionate about technology, I always try to keep up to date with the news of the .NET ecosystem and I have solid knowledge in C#, Azure, CI/CD with Azure Devops, Entity Framework, SQL Server, among other related technologies.

For a few months I have been directing my studies in Cloud Techonologies, and thanks to that I managed to get some related Certifications, namely: AZ-204, AZ-900 and AWS Cloud Practitioner.

Beyond the 'universe' of software development, my hobbies are playing instruments such as drums, guitar or bass, and practicing fighting as a way to maintain physical fitness.
Also, as a huge aviation lover, I love flying commercial planes in flight simulators like Flight Simulator or X-Plane.
However my favorite hobby is play with my cats, which usually involves a lot of fur, lots of scratching, biting, and sometimes some light bleeding on my hands.ðŸ˜¹ ðŸ˜¸
